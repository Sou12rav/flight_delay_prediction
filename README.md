# Flight Delay Prediction

This repository contains a Flight Delay Prediction project that uses machine learning techniques to predict delays in flights. The project utilizes a dataset of historical flight data and various machine learning algorithms to build and evaluate prediction models.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to predict whether a flight will be delayed based on several features such as departure time, arrival time, airline, origin and destination airports, and weather conditions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to improve model performance.
- **Modeling**: Building and training machine learning models to predict flight delays.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the models using various metrics.
- **Deployment**: Deploying the best model using a web-based interface for real-time predictions.



## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the raw and processed data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and feature engineering.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Directory to save trained models.
- `app.py`: Streamlit app for deploying the prediction model.
