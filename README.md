# Flight Delay Prediction

This repository contains a Flight Delay Prediction project that uses machine learning techniques to predict delays in flights. The project utilizes a dataset of historical flight data and various machine learning algorithms to build and evaluate prediction models.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to predict whether a flight will be delayed based on several features such as departure time, arrival time, airline, origin and destination airports, and weather conditions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to improve model performance.
- **Modeling**: Building and training machine learning models to predict flight delays.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the models using various metrics.
- **Deployment**: Deploying the best model using a web-based interface for real-time predictions.


## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the dataset.

```bash
python preprocess_data.py
```

2. **Model Training**: Train the machine learning models using the preprocessed data.

```bash
python train_model.py
```

3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained models.

```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```

4. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the best model using a web-based interface.

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
